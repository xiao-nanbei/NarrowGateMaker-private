This is the single current architecture guide. The private repository is the development source; the public repository distributes reviewed source, not a competing implementation. Model weights, purchased inputs and private runtime evidence remain outside versioned source; see the [public/private contract](public_private_documentation_contract.md).

## Module responsibilities

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `data/`, `data/downloaders/` | Acquisition, source-bound facts, causal observations and input validation; not live state |
| `features/` | Shared feature engineering, including `quote_ev.py` |
| `narrowgate/runtime/` | Shared epoch identity and restored runtime state |
| `strategy/` | Live/replay quote, signal, policy and inventory logic |
| `execution/` | Own-order lifecycle, depth paths and queue bounds; not venue transport |
| `live/`, `live/orderbook/` | Live process/configuration and execution-market book reconstruction |
| `models/`, `models/replay/` | Transitional training/replay packages, tick executor, queues, windows and accounting |
| `models/audit/` | Existing shared audit consumers; not the default owner for new family-specific studies |
| `research/families/` | Family-specific models, experiments and public explanations |
| `research/shared/` | Shared-layer ownership indexes; implementations stay with runtime owners |
| `research/system_engineering/`, `research/governance/` | Engineering studies, experiment governance and layout archives |
| `narrowgate/`, `frontend/` | CLI and UI; not yet the sole core package |
| `cpp/`, `bench/`, `tests/` | Native implementation, labelled benchmarks and behavior/parity regressions |
| `scripts/`, `docs/` | Maintenance/deployment tools and maintained guides |
| `tools/poolrun/` | Independently installed generic finite-batch scheduler; no implicit takeover of research or live jobs |

Market payloads, generated logs and results are not source code. Storage and acquisition commands are maintained only in the [data guide](../data/README.md); family evidence belongs to its registered owner.

## Dependency direction

Research consumes shared data, features and runtime contracts; new runtime contracts must not depend on research-family implementations. F05 may re-export shared features for its existing API, but must not keep a second implementation. Keep facts separate from strategy-visible observations, predictions from actions, and funding settlement from features. Live, training and replay retain separate state lifecycles. Native paths require fixed-input Python parity.

Extend the registered family in place; do not restore removed root `research_*` aliases, symlinks or duplicate source trees. A matching filename does not imply matching semantics. Existing shared audit/governance consumers are transitional, not a reason to move all research there.

## Maintained entry points

- [PoolRun Lite](../tools/poolrun/README.md): an optional Python 3.12+ subproject with its own environment, `poolrun` CLI, tests and synthetic examples. It is not included in the default NarrowGate installation; production adapters and cross-host acceptance remain operator responsibilities.
- [Data](../data/README.md): `python -m data` and explicit historical adapters.
- [Models](../models/README.md): `models/backtest_tick.py` is the Python reference executor; do not enlarge it with unrelated helpers.
- [Research](../research/README.md): the [407-day work list](../research/recompute_407.json) and each selected experiment own current inputs, methods and permissions; old closure states do not block new studies.
- F01 current public-input entry: [`public_input.py`](../research/families/f01_fixed_parameter_racing/public_input.py), with independent arms in `iter_parameter_candidates()` and complete shared settlement in `replay_economic_candidates()`. `inventory_lifecycle_outcome_replay_audit.py`, `parameter_racing_sweep.py`, `parameter_selection.py`, and `build_paired_daily_evidence()` / `audit/paired_screening.py` retain their historical or specific execution contracts; their old defaults and `paired_daily_selection()` are not the current entry.
- Existing shared gates: `models/audit/experiment_scorecard.py` and `panel_promotion_controller.py`; these do not grant live authority or impose one inventory lifecycle contract on every new study.
- Existing attribution/diagnostics: `models/alpha_evidence_ledger.py`, `research.families.f10_live_replay_attribution.audit.runner`, and F05 `audit.order_score_fast` / `audit.fill_selection_score`. Diagnostic buckets and scores are not policies or deployment evidence.
- [Contributor checks and CI](dev/ci.md): local verification and hosted-check responsibilities.

## Shared inputs and module ownership

Eight acquisition adapters live in `data/downloaders/`. `data/facts.py`, `data/observation.py` and `data/runtime.py` provide shared input infrastructure; their presence is not proof of complete real-data validation. `narrowgate/runtime/` owns epoch contracts, and `features/quote_ev.py` owns scalar quote-EV features. Family source uses `research.families.*` packages.

## Supported execution boundaries

### Replay restoration scope

The maintained Python ConsumerBundle entry, `simulate_prepared_inputs`, accepts `checkpoint_at_ts_ms` and `resume_checkpoint`. `models/replay/runtime_checkpoint_io.py` persists the owned account/order/queue/RNG/policy graph; the prepared entry binds the input manifest, effective parameters, numeric predictions and execution-owner source. An output directory and progress callback are process-local rather than economic inputs. Resume restores the saved strategy, not a freshly initialized substitute. A checkpoint is trusted local implementation state, not a portable artifact or an accepted web upload.

`ReplayL2Journal` seals an immutable prefix without fabricating account closure, then copies verified records into a separate branch writer with their original logical event identities. Each branch continues independent production/submission/read-back counts. Tests cover persisted independent branches, public F06/F07 policy state, cold signal startup, asynchronous execution, pending order transitions and UTC accounting boundaries. Source/input/parameter mismatches and changed journal prefixes are errors, not compatibility fallbacks. Retired Makefile wrappers are removed; installed `narrowgate data` and `narrowgate replay` commands own those CLI surfaces.

A full previously evaluated two-day development F05 account was saved at the intervening UTC midnight and restored in a new process. All 1,082 fills and 452,728 L2 records, policy counters, UTC marks and complete accounting matched the retained cold-run baseline exactly; net PnL difference was zero. This is one engineering replay, no new fit or candidate. The source-bound receipt is indexed in the [existing work list](../research/recompute_407.json); underlying inputs and receipts are private, not distributed. The ten obsolete-loader fixture failures have since been closed by removing the retired loader/reload chain and migrating the tests to current admission rejection and component invariance. The targeted closure suite passes 535 tests; this is not a claim that every repository test passes.

Native cooldown exports/restores complete value state, bound to configuration, binary and policy source, with new process-local locks. An explicitly authorized development072 engineering configuration changes only the two cooldown enable flags, preserving its original coefficient axis, ML parameters and F05 action. A new uninterrupted full account and a new-process midnight restoration match exactly: 980 fills, 419,755 L2 events, 490 cooldown decisions, inventory, fees, funding, UTC accounting and net PnL (difference zero). The cut retains nonzero inventory, an active order, unexpired SELL cooldown and pending native windows; exported state is exact before the next event. Operational wall-time telemetry is separate. Prepared-checkpoint binding now handles immutable cooldown inputs rather than attempting to JSON-serialize the runtime object; 30 focused tests pass, including two added cases. This does not establish cooldown profitability, arbitrary cross-version recovery, the full C++ tick loop, every filesystem failure, or F06/F07 scientific completion. Deferred mutable variance outputs remain unsupported. Frozen environments, workload budgets and compute windows still apply.

The isolated Linux candidate reuses its verified build, installed environment and earlier 270-test evidence. The owner-selected new Tardis coefficient axis0.05/asymmetry0.1 configuration now passes real-market assembly through MakerEngine, shared features, all13 heads, P3, native quoting and a nontrading intent recorder. Two warmed decisions and four intents match the local reference exactly; only lock wait/hold telemetry differs. The real Tardis observations use an explicitly simulated ordered transport, not proven native receive/sequence parity. This is candidate assembly acceptance, not activation, profitability or exhaustive market coverage. No current pointer, service or production configuration changed. Private source-bound receipts are indexed in the existing work list and are not distributed; independent from-start parameter research remains independent of unrelated engineering work.

Executor decomposition, governance ownership consolidation, deployment/maintenance script separation, full `src/narrowgate` consolidation and root-manual shortening remain unfinished. Do not move active research code or split the large executor as a side effect of documentation cleanup. Future extraction needs bounded responsibilities and fixed-input quote/order/inventory/accounting regressions.

Before removing a historical entry, check imports, CLI/script/test consumers and frozen identities, and verify an actual recoverable source/material archive. A mutable alpha commit is not a recovery guarantee. Preserve historical evidence unchanged; do not replace its hashes with today's source or add missing-file skips. Generated caches and private results are not cleanup targets of this consolidation.
