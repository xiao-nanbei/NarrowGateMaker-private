This runbook describes a reusable AWS EC2 deployment pattern for the public
NarrowGateMaker code. It contains no current host, credential, account state,
active release, strategy parameter, or artifact identity. `203.0.113.10` is an
RFC 5737 documentation address, not a deployment target.

The local synthetic demo is the five-minute quickstart. A live deployment is a
separate, owner-operated process with private configuration and venue authority.

## Public/private boundary

The public repository supplies source publication, runtime verification,
deployment-envelope, reconciliation, and process-entry tools. The operator must
supply and retain outside the Git checkout:

- the actual host and access route;
- credentials and service environment;
- active config, model, policy, and authorization bundles;
- Linux wheels, dependency lock, and wheelhouse;
- deployment, reconciliation, activation, and rollback records;
- current health and account/order/position state.

Never paste those values into this runbook, an issue, a test fixture, or a
tracked example. Commands below use logical placeholders only.

## One-time instance preparation

Use a supported 64-bit Linux image with systemd and CPython 3.12. Build Linux
wheels on a controlled Linux builder or CI runner, not by downloading arbitrary
dependencies during activation.

Never compile the native extension on the EC2 host while `narrowgate.service`,
a legacy `narrowgate-maker.service`, or any maker process is running. The
canonical `make native-live-wheel` entry point enforces that boundary, defaults
to one compile job, and refuses to start below 2,048 MiB `MemAvailable`. A 2 GiB
live host is therefore not an admitted build host. Prefer a controlled Linux
x86_64 Azure builder with at least 16 GiB RAM and exact GNU C++ 11.5.0, but run
it inside an Amazon Linux 2023 or manylinux_2_34-compatible glibc 2.34 rootfs
with CPython 3.12. Generic Ubuntu 24.04/glibc 2.39 output is not an EC2 release
artifact. Build the live-only `ec2-cascadelake-avx2` wheel there, then transfer
the immutable wheel into the release wheelhouse. Do not use the Azure host's
`-march=native`.
Before network access is disabled, populate the dedicated builder environment
from a controlled local wheelhouse with the build requirements declared by
`cpp/pyproject.toml` and their transitive dependencies. The production target
uses `--no-build-isolation --check-build-dependencies` with `PIP_NO_INDEX=1`;
a missing build dependency is a bootstrap failure, not permission to resolve it
from the network. Build-tool versions remain measured builder inputs until the
Amazon Linux 2023 qualification freezes them.
Installation on EC2 must still pass the native build receipt, import, and
Python/C++ parity checks; target-host performance measurements remain EC2-only.

Host requirements:

- encrypted root storage;
- no public application port;
- administrative access restricted to an approved route;
- only the outbound venue and operating endpoints needed by the deployment;
- an unprivileged `narrowgate` service user;
- separate release and private-artifact roots;
- systemd as the only live process owner.

For SSH examples, an operator may place an alias in `~/.ssh/config` and use:

```text
Host narrowgate-example
    HostName 203.0.113.10
    User narrowgate
```

The address is documentation-only. Prefer AWS Systems Manager Session Manager
when available, or limit the EC2 security group to the operator's real source
network. Do not commit a proxy, key path, host key, or real address.

Create stable roots once:

```bash
sudo useradd --system --create-home --shell /bin/bash narrowgate
sudo install -d -o narrowgate -g narrowgate -m 0755 /opt/narrowgate/releases
sudo install -d -o narrowgate -g narrowgate -m 0700 /opt/narrowgate/private
sudo install -d -o root -g root -m 0700 /etc/narrowgate/releases
```

The release checkout contains public source only. The private root contains the
release-scoped runtime and private inputs. A root-owned mode-`0600` environment
file selects them for systemd without putting credentials on a command line.

## First release

From a clean operator/build checkout, publish one exact source release:

```bash
export NARROWGATE_RELEASE_TAG="<annotated-release-tag>"
export NARROWGATE_DEPLOY_TARGET="narrowgate@narrowgate-example"
export NARROWGATE_RELEASE_DIR="/opt/narrowgate/releases/<release-id>"

make publish-source-dry
make publish-source
```

When native inputs changed, produce the immutable native wheel on the controlled
builder before staging the runtime closure:

```bash
make native-live-wheel
```

The target writes to `dist/native/live/<full-git-commit>/` by default, so a
live-only artifact cannot collide with a full developer wheel or a wheel from a
different commit. It excludes tick replay, the F03 batch runtime, F06/F07, and
the dynamic-hazard research runtime. The default developer CMake build remains
the full extension. It performs no package-index access and consumes the
already prepared build environment. The production target is intentionally
independent of `publish-source`, deployment preflight, installation, and
activation; none of those live-host operations may compile source.

`publish-source` transports source only. It must not transfer credentials,
private config, models, policy artifacts, runtime receipts, or process-control
authority, and it must not start or restart live.

Use the operator's approved private channel to place the complete Linux runtime
closure under `/opt/narrowgate/private/<release-id>`. Then:

1. create `venv-<execution-commit>` with `live.deployment_runtime install`;
2. run `verify-install` and `verify-static-tree`;
3. expose that exact environment through the release's ignored `.venv-active`
   selector;
4. run `live.native_build_receipt` from the installed environment so the native
   ABI and Python/C++ parity smoke are bound to this release;
5. run `make deploy-preflight` against the private active config;
6. build the deployment envelope from the exact config, runtime, native, model,
   and enabled policy bundle;
7. keep all emitted records in the release-scoped private directory.

Use the command help as the canonical field reference instead of copying a
release-specific command transcript into documentation:

```bash
python3.12 -m live.deployment_runtime install --help
python3.12 -m live.deployment_runtime verify-install --help
python3.12 -m live.deployment_runtime verify-static-tree --help
python3.12 -m live.deployment_runtime build-envelope --help
python3.12 -m live.native_build_receipt --help
```

An incomplete artifact closure is a staging failure. Do not repair it by
allowing network dependency resolution on the live host.

## Python-only incremental release

### Validation boundaries

Deployment preflight validates one immutable model generation once and reuses that call's authorization locator; independent loads and deployments validate again. Offline `SignalEngine.from_public_models` and the network-free `LivePublicSignalEngine` constructor check model compatibility, not live authority. Actual live startup still requires the hash-bound deployment authorization. Training-plan provenance completeness and the F03 half-life grid are checked by `public_input_panel.head_training_identity` during publication; inference retains the recorded provenance and cross-head identities without imposing that research grid.

Deployment JSON identity uses its canonical object digest, not indentation, key order or a final newline. Duplicate keys and nonfinite values are rejected. Raw frozen model/P3 and explicitly byte-bound artifact hashes are unchanged. YAML preflight uses the runtime configuration schema, not the `PUBLIC TEMPLATE` comment. Missing targets, unknown keys, placeholder credentials and inadmissible artifact identities remain errors.

Startup retains a full installed RECORD/tree check and `pip check`: this change does not establish an immutable runtime filesystem. Within one verification call the static scan is reused for the interpreter comparison rather than scanning the same tree again in the target process. Consequently it no longer independently detects a dependency mutation occurring specifically between those two formerly adjacent scans; installation retains its before/after-target check. Independent process admission still verifies again. The bootstrap checks the verifier against its committed Git blob; the verifier then performs the sole complete source check. Only non-executable, non-symlink Markdown in `docs/` and the two root README files is exempt from dirty-worktree rejection. Executable/import/config changes remain rejected, and separately bound input bytes remain protected. No startup-time, quote-latency or PnL speedup is claimed.

For a scoped native qualification, run `live.native_build_receipt --active-config <private-config>` with the intended existing runtime profile loaded. It reuses live capability selection and selects the corresponding existing parity tests; the receipt consumer validates that exact capability contract, and live admission requires every active API to have been qualified. Without `--active-config`, full-build qualification remains available. Disabled cooldown policies do not require cooldown APIs. The current signal constructor still consumes native feature/173-row components when their profile flags are enabled; those requirements cannot be removed merely because public inference later uses a different stream. CPU build options, floating-point semantics, active ABI checks and module identity are unchanged. These local code/tests are not an AWS activation or proof of a newly qualified Linux wheel.

A Python-only change can reuse the exact admitted native wheel bytes only when
all of the following are true:

- no C++ source, compiler/runtime dependency, binding declaration, native ABI,
  or native build option changed;
- the reused wheel is compatible with the target OS, architecture, and CPython;
- the new release still passes the native import and Python/C++ parity smoke;
- the operator builds a new Python root wheel from the new clean commit.

Prove the first condition by comparing the two immutable release trees that
will actually run, including `cpp/`, `pyproject.toml`, the native build options,
and the dependency/toolchain identity. Do not assume `git diff <old> <new>` is
available: a cherry-picked release graph or a minimal Git bundle may not contain
the old commit object. If the release-tree comparison finds any native input
change, rebuild the native wheel.

Reusing the native wheel does **not** authorize reusing the old virtual
environment, install receipt, native receipt, envelope, or reconciliation. Those
records bind the old source/runtime relationship.

The incremental sequence is:

1. publish the new exact source release;
2. compare the old and new immutable native-input trees, then copy or reference
   the already admitted native wheel only when they are equal;
3. build the new root wheel from the new commit;
4. create a new `venv-<new-execution-commit>` from the frozen wheelhouse;
5. generate and verify a new install receipt;
6. rerun `live.native_build_receipt` against the reused native wheel, new root
   wheel, new environment, and new execution commit;
7. rerun parity smoke and preflight;
8. build a new deployment envelope;
9. perform a fresh stopped reconciliation and normal activation.

This path removes unnecessary native compilation from routine Python changes
without weakening the commit-bound runtime proof. If native compatibility cannot
be established, rebuild the native wheel instead of guessing.

## systemd is the sole process owner

Use one systemd unit. `live/run.sh service` verifies startup once and then
replaces itself with the maker process. Do not combine this unit with `nohup`, a
second supervisor, a cron restart, or manual `run.sh start|stop` operations.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=NarrowGate live maker
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=narrowgate
WorkingDirectory=/opt/narrowgate/current
EnvironmentFile=/etc/narrowgate/releases/<release-id>.env
ExecStart=/opt/narrowgate/current/live/run.sh service
ExecReload=/opt/narrowgate/current/live/run.sh reload
Restart=no
KillSignal=SIGTERM
TimeoutStartSec=120
TimeoutStopSec=120

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

systemd must send `SIGTERM` directly and retain the full stop grace period. Do
not add a second five-second kill ladder through `ExecStop`.

## Fresh reconciliation before every activation

Every start, restart, rollback, or instance resume needs a newly created stopped
exchange reconciliation. A previous file proves only an earlier stopped moment.

For a release whose source, private environment, active config, locked runtime,
and deployment envelope are already prepared on EC2, use the single transaction
entry point rather than manually stitching the activation steps together:

```bash
python3.12 scripts/live_deploy_common.py activate-prepared-release --help
```

It defaults to a non-mutating dry-run; `--execute` enables the one-SSH remote
transaction. The default service identity is the validated EC2 contract user
`ec2-user`; use `--service-user` for another valid non-root identity. Failure
before stop leaves the old service alone. Failure after stop leaves the host
stopped, and failure after candidate start but before pointer rename stops that
candidate. It never
blindly restarts the old release, and it publishes the current pointer only
after bounded health admission. When the approved control path requires SOCKS5,
pass only the validated `--socks5-proxy HOST:PORT` option; arbitrary SSH options
are not accepted.

The normal prepared transaction admits a running transient
`narrowgate.service`. It proves `active/running`, `Transient=yes`, the exact
previous working directory, positive `MainPID`, matching `/proc/<pid>/cwd`, and
the previous release's `live/main.py` command line before stop. A persistent
unit or ambiguous process fails before stop and is not modified. Use
`--resume-stopped` after an operator-verified graceful stop (including an
intentional bounded-run expiry), or after this transaction stopped the verified
previous release but failed before reconciliation. Verify the selected process's
actual shutdown log and successful systemd invocation first; an absent unit or
an old healthy snapshot does not establish a graceful stop. This is an explicit
operator action, never an automatic restart. Unexplained or runtime-fatal exits
must be diagnosed first; exit 78 uses the recovery mode below. This mode requires
an inactive/absent unit, exact process quiescence, the unchanged previous
current pointer, and absent reconciliation/activation outputs; it re-verifies
the candidate before producing a fresh reconciliation.

If the selected live process later exits 78 because execution state is
uncertain, use the separate `--recover-runtime-fatal` mode. Supply the selected
release's deployment envelope, activation receipt, and stopped reconciliation
as lineage evidence. The transaction also verifies the activation-bound
runtime identity, matching runtime-health PID, and the same systemd journal invocation's operator-gated message and `EXIT_STATUS=78`. Normally health must record the final fail-closed state. If the health writer failed, that exact process and invocation must additionally record the final-health publication failure before the fatal message; a stale healthy snapshot alone cannot admit recovery. It accepts
only an inactive or absent unit with no maker or supervisor process. New candidate
reconciliation and activation paths must be unique and absent; old files are
never treated as fresh. A missing or rotated journal proof leaves the host
stopped. This mode does not broaden `--resume-stopped`.

Both journal lookups are bounded and streamed: first by the runtime-identity
PID and timestamp, then by the discovered systemd invocation. Recovery never
buffers the unit's complete journal history in EC2 memory.

The private systemd `EnvironmentFile` uses standalone `NAME=value` records and
must end with a newline before deployment grants are appended. Validate only
key presence and syntax; never print secret values.

Admission also requires `reconciliationPending=false` and a finite
`lastTickAge` in `[0, 1s]`, derived from the existing 100 ms main-loop safety
clock with bounded scheduler allowance. The private user stream must be
connected with the same positive connection generation across advancing health
observations; no private fill or user event is required. Pointer rename is the
commit point. A later parent-directory `fsync` failure is reported as an
uncertain commit while the candidate remains running for manual verification.

The process-level startup boundary is private-first: warm-up and stale-order
cancellation, private-stream readiness, exact reconciliation under a complete
private-callback barrier, prospective epoch publication and asynchronous writer
attachment, callback release, public-market startup, then periodic metrics
polling. This order prevents a market event or half-processed private callback
from crossing the initial-state/evidence boundary.

Safe normal activation order:

1. verify the prepared candidate and deployment envelope while the old service
   is still running;
2. stop systemd and wait for graceful process exit;
3. confirm no maker process remains;
4. create a unique, previously absent reconciliation output while live is fully
   stopped;
5. require the signed venue reads to show zero open orders and a stable exact
   position under the intended credential/config;
6. start the prepared release through systemd;
7. observe process and runtime health for a bounded interval;
8. build the activation receipt;
9. publish the current pointer last.

Runtime-fatal recovery does not perform steps 1–3 against an already dead
service. It first verifies the selected release lineage, its final fail-closed health or the authenticated publication-failure path above, the authentic systemd exit-78 invocation, and global process
quiescence. It then joins the same transaction at step 4 with a new
reconciliation output; steps 4–9 remain unchanged.

Run reconciliation through a bounded transient systemd unit so it receives the
same root-owned environment without exposing credentials in the operator shell.
Use a unique unit and output name for every attempt. A condition-skipped or
collected unit is not fresh success.

## Interpreting `LoadState=not-found`

Use a bounded read-only status query:

```bash
sudo systemctl show narrowgate.service \
  --property=LoadState,ActiveState,SubState,MainPID,ExecMainStatus,StateChangeTimestamp
```

`LoadState=not-found` means systemd currently has no loaded unit definition with
that name. It does **not** by itself prove that:

- the maker process is absent;
- exchange orders are absent;
- the position is reconciled;
- a transient unit completed successfully.

If `narrowgate.service` is intended to be persistent, `not-found` is a host
configuration error: restore/reload the reviewed unit before activation. If a
collected transient unit is expected, confirm its command result and newly
created output separately. In either case, inspect the process family and run a
fresh stopped reconciliation before treating the host as safe to activate or
stop.

## Health admission and current pointer

A running PID is necessary but insufficient. Admission must confirm:

- systemd reports one active main process and no restart loop;
- runtime health is current and the quote loop is advancing;
- position and open-order reconciliation has converged;
- no ownership conflict, fatal runtime, or reconciliation-required latch is
  active;
- expected market-data and private-event clocks are current;
- recent logs contain no unknown execution state.

After health admission, create a new activation receipt and publish the compact
current pointer with `live.deployment_runtime`. The pointer is only a selector:

```json
{
  "release_id": "<release-id>",
  "schema_version": "<current-pointer-schema>",
  "status": "selected_release"
}
```

`selected_release` records selection only, not activation or health. `select-current-release --release-id <release-id> --release-root <existing-release-directory> --output <private-current-pointer>` can select an unstarted candidate. Actual activation remains separately recorded and validated. Do not expand
the pointer with leaf artifact inventories, host routing, account state, or live
metrics.

## Live hot-path runtime contracts

The admitted process keeps canonical evidence and health publication off the
decision and private-event threads. One bounded FIFO worker owns the CSV
descriptors and atomic JSON publications. Producers freeze each payload before
admission; accepted items retain one global sequence and are never silently
dropped or reordered. Queue exhaustion or worker/I/O failure is a fatal,
health-visible condition, not a successful collection. Normal shutdown stops
new admission, waits for the FIFO barrier, drains every accepted item, flushes
and closes the descriptors, and reports accepted, committed, and uncommitted
counts. This is an in-process ordering guarantee, not protection against power,
kernel, or storage loss.

USD-M REST traffic is split into persistent single-owner sessions. The runtime
allocates BUY, SELL, and safety order sessions, but the behavior-identical
default routes BUY, SELL, and cancel-all through one global legacy order
session. The side sessions become active only in the explicit cross-side A/B
arm. Reconciliation, its worker fetch, market snapshots, metrics, and
listen-key maintenance always use separate cold-role sessions. Each pool is
bounded and has automatic HTTP retries disabled. This prevents a slow cold
request from occupying the active order connection and prevents an ambiguous
order write from being replayed automatically. A timed-out or otherwise
uncertain write still requires exchange reconciliation.

Asynchronous response isolation and cross-side concurrency are separate,
restart-only A/B switches, and both are disabled by default. Enabling only
`async_order_lanes_enabled` moves response waiting off the decision thread but
keeps BUY and SELL writes in one `GLOBAL` FIFO, preserving their cross-side
arrival order. Enabling `cross_side_order_lanes_enabled` additionally creates
independent BUY and SELL lanes; that changes exchange arrival timing and is an
economic lifecycle experiment, not a transparent performance refactor.

On a 2-vCPU/4-GiB host, evidence and order-lane queues remain bounded, GC
telemetry uses fixed histogram buckets rather than retaining samples, and cold
reconciliation work is single-flight. Do not run multiple cold reconciliation
fetches concurrently on that host class: preserve memory headroom and one CPU
for the decision, private-event, and safety paths.

The fill-cooldown checkpoint must never delay the immediate risk response to a
fill. The engine first issues the required cancel of continuing
exposure-increasing orders, then commits the updated checkpoint to the
sequence-numbered, checksummed two-slot WAL. Startup restores the newest valid
slot, cancels stale exchange orders, reconciles any trade gap, and completes
position/open-order admission before quoting resumes. Changes to this ordering
require crash tests at every write boundary, including torn newest-slot,
restart-gap, duplicate-fill, and stale-order cases.

Signal computation has two distinct paths. A request for an already completed
10-second bucket returns from the cache before copying historical bars or L2.
When the native signal profile is active, a new bucket updates rolling
execution-book state incrementally in the C++ ring and materializes only the
required features; the Python fallback does not claim that optimization. Both
paths must preserve feature, causal-cutoff, prediction, and action parity.
Activation must expose which path is active, and latency reporting must keep
`cached`, `new_bucket`, and `catch_up` samples separate.

## Bounded WebSocket order-gateway A/B

Persistent REST remains the production default. `websocket_api_ab` is a
restart-only, short qualification transport for the exact official USD-M
WebSocket API endpoint; it is not a hot-reload switch or an automatic fallback.
Prepare it as a separate immutable release/config envelope while retaining a
fully prepared REST rollback release.

The gateway preconnects, permits at most one in-flight request, assigns a unique
request identity, and emits per-request evidence through the central FIFO. The
evidence must preserve transport request identity, client order identity,
dispatch time, authoritative ACK/error time, outcome, and connection
generation. Once a frame may have been dispatched, timeout or disconnect is
`UNKNOWN`: do not retry the write; stop new authority and reconcile.

Before activation, set a hard `max_runtime_s` and schedule the verified REST
rollback to begin with enough margin to finish **before** that bound. The hard
timer is only a fail-safe that stops the candidate; it is not a rollback
mechanism. If the active rollback cannot complete, leave the host stopped and
reconcile rather than extending the experiment.

Do not pass the renderer's multiline Bash command directly as a
`systemd-run ... /bin/bash -c` argument. The current systemd command-line
expansion collapses `$$` to `$`; a literal probe then reaches Bash as
`/proc/$/fd/9`, invalidating the transaction's file-descriptor identity check.
Write the existing renderer output to an owner-only script, validate it with
`bash -n`, and have a system-level one-shot timer run that script as
`User=ec2-user`. The transaction itself must not run as root, gain a new
manifest or SHA layer, or automatically select runtime-fatal recovery. If the
WebSocket process exits fatally before the ordinary rollback starts, leave the
host stopped for explicit reconciliation and recovery.

Compare REST and WebSocket on the same request/client-order identity using
decision-to-private-visibility
latency plus authoritative outcome and `UNKNOWN` rates. Do not use an internal
decision-to-wire timestamp as the primary cross-transport metric: the current
REST SDK does not expose wire time at a directly comparable observation point.
Report ACK/error latency and reconnects as supporting diagnostics. A lower ACK
p99 alone does not authorize the transport.

## Post-activation latency observation

Health admission proves that the release started safely; it does not prove a
latency improvement. When a release changes the live hot path, observe it with
one release and process epoch at a time and exclude restart/warm-up rows.

- For `live_perf_telemetry.csv`, select `event=requote,status=ok`; reject
  negative or non-finite durations and report sample count plus p50, p95, p99,
  and maximum for total requote, quote computation, and order update.
- Split signal timing by its recorded path (`cached`, `new_bucket`, or
  `catch_up`) instead of pooling unlike work.
- Compute REST distributions only from rows where the operation occurred and
  report the request count. Aggregated count/sum health fields support a mean,
  not a p99. For REST/WebSocket comparison, use matched request/client-order
  identities and report decision-to-private-visibility plus authoritative
  outcome/`UNKNOWN`; do not compare transport-internal wire timestamps that do
  not share an observation contract.
- For terminal-driven replacement, count `arm`, `publish`, `decision`, and
  `drop` markers, split terminal-visible-to-decision latency by side, and report
  every drop reason.
- Record the systemd restart count and non-`ok` outcomes separately; a shorter
  successful-path distribution must not hide failures or restart churn.

Adjacent, non-overlapping market windows are operational observations, not a
controlled causal comparison. Passing a latency target also does not establish
PnL improvement, economic no-harm, or action authority.

## Stop, resume, and rollback

To stop the instance safely: stop systemd, confirm process exit, create a fresh
stopped reconciliation, and only then request the EC2 stop from an approved
control host. If any check is unavailable or uncertain, leave the instance on
and reconcile manually.

Starting an existing instance is not an activation. Confirm systemd remains
inactive, verify the selected release and static runtime, create a fresh stopped
reconciliation, then start and repeat health admission.

Rollback is another verified deployment. It repeats stop, fresh reconciliation,
selector change, startup, health admission, activation receipt, and pointer
publication. Never restart blindly from an old reconciliation or pointer.
