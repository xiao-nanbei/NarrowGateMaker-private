## What is available

The data calendar defaults to current processed products; raw inputs have their own tab. An explicit dataset `lifecycle: historical` moves superseded versions to **Historical versions**, excluding them from current-layer filters, counts and gap lists without deleting files or altering audits. Missing lifecycle metadata defaults to current for existing registrations. History is independent of raw/processed stage and is never inferred from filenames. A historical registry's unobserved dates do not mean the current selected dataset is missing those dates.

For example, `normalized_l2_100ms_v2_minimal141_20260727` is a historical normalized-book registry: `registry_20260727` selects its original 133 days and `minimal_good_day_extension` the additional eight. These are registry subsets, not two extra raw providers or 141 universally qualified days. Retain referenced historical inputs; use the current selected product and its scoped checks for new data preparation. Calendar preparation does not require a full-period economic replay, and snapshot carry-forward must not erase source gaps or imply observed queue events.

Replay Studio now provides a browser workbench, a durable control service and an independent HTTP worker. The first adapter executes the existing [public synthetic replay](../../examples/replay_demo/README.md); it does not implement another matching engine. A submitted experiment survives a browser or SSH disconnect. Control state and published artifacts survive a control-process restart when its state directory is retained.

Completed owner-private B0 results can be imported for read-only inspection, separately from synthetic jobs. An optional operator-registered offline adapter can now queue fixed, already-prepared research, training or data-processing plans on registered resources. It invokes the existing CLI rather than implementing another replay engine. No real plan ships enabled in a public clone. Creating two demo arms still runs the same fixture twice with separate output directories; their names do not create different economic policies.

The service exposes no maker, cloud-provisioning or strategy-promotion action. Demo submission accepts only the built-in synthetic dataset; the separate offline submission accepts only a registered plan ID and resource ID. Operator plans are trusted, reviewed offline programs, not untrusted scripts running in a sandbox. Keep live credentials and live startup out of their runtime. Do not upload private market, account or research artifacts through the demo adapter. B0 result import is an owner-local CLI operation, not an HTTP upload or arbitrary-path endpoint.

## Run the closed loop

Use the same tested checkout or installed wheel on the control host and workers. Python 3.11 or newer is required. An installed wheel includes the built frontend; readers do not need Node.js.

```bash
python -m pip install ".[studio]"
python -m narrowgate.studio serve --state-dir ./results/studio-control --port 8080
```

In another terminal or service:

```bash
python -m narrowgate.studio worker \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --worker-id worker-a \
  --work-dir ./results/studio-worker-a
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, create a demo experiment, and inspect its orders, event trace, inventory lifecycle, ledger and original logs. A second independent worker uses a different worker ID and work directory. Each worker owns at most one unfinished job. Two workers can execute two independent arms concurrently; do not interpret this as permission to split continuous inventory paths into fresh-start UTC days.

Frontend development and reproducible builds are described in [frontend/README.md](../../frontend/README.md). The public [one-day data tutorial](../opensource/one_day_data_pipeline.md) remains the route for real-data diagnostics outside Studio.

## Import completed B0 results without replay

The owner supplies an existing private `baseline_summary.json` beside its `input_plan.json` and selected final segment outputs. These are private evidence store inputs, not distributed with the public repository. Use the same owner-only state directory (mode `0700`) as the control service:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m narrowgate.studio import-b0 \
  --state-dir "${NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR}/studio-control" \
  --summary "${NARROWGATE_PRIVATE_EVIDENCE_ROOT}/<tag>/baseline_summary.json"
```

The importer follows only explicitly selected segment stems and reads the small summary, input plan, segment metadata and aggregate CSV. It checks coverage, completed baseline/config metadata and amount consistency. Raw fill, inventory lifecycle and funding files are checked for existence only, not reread or rehashed. Missing, partial, overlapping and out-of-root sources are rejected. An allowlisted compact report is stored in the existing private SQLite database, without raw artifacts or source paths; one summary-derived ID makes repeat imports idempotent. Changes to subsequent research phase, training or execution-permission descriptions do not block viewing an existing B0. Import creates no job and starts no replay, worker, Azure synchronization or cloud resource.

The separate “真实 B0” view uses read-only `/api/results` endpoints. It shows covered UTC days, continuous segments, accounting amounts, selected local/Azure execution origins and the source summary's existing cross-host verification statement. Origin is provenance, not current cloud liveness. Import consistency checks do not repeat the original fill/funding or cross-host qualification. `daily.csv` rows remain segment aggregates; the UI does not invent daily returns, Sharpe or an account equity curve. Trading PnL already includes fees and terminal MTM; funding is added exactly once. Missing native queue coverage and modeled-runtime limitations remain visible. Synthetic demo jobs and their workers stay separate.

## Connect market context and simulated historical fills

After importing the report, the owner can create a private display index from those same selected final fill traces and connect existing BTCUSDC market bars. This does not replay the strategy or modify its summary, artifacts or accounting. The optional `--bars-dir` names retained `BTCUSDC-1s-YYYY-MM-DD.parquet` files; without it, fill queries work while candles explicitly remain unavailable.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m narrowgate.studio connect-b0 \
  --state-dir "${NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR}/studio-control" \
  --result-id "<imported-result-id>" \
  --summary "${NARROWGATE_PRIVATE_EVIDENCE_ROOT}/<tag>/baseline_summary.json" \
  --bars-dir "${NARROWGATE_DATA_ROOT}/bars_1s"
```

The connection and derived fill index stay in owner-only SQLite. Only the CLI can register local paths; browser APIs accept result IDs, UTC time windows and page cursors, never arbitrary paths. Reconnecting replaces only the display index, not the immutable imported report. No raw market files are copied, hashed again or uploaded.

`GET /api/results/{id}/market` reports segment/day coverage and source availability. `GET /api/results/{id}/candles` requires a half-open UTC millisecond window (`start_ms`, `end_ms`) of at most 24 hours, aligned to `interval_s` in `1,5,60,300`, with at most 5,000 candles. OHLC and volume are aggregated only from retained market bars; absent seconds stay absent, without forward-filling. Their count does not distinguish a no-trade second from a source gap. These bars are historical market context, explicitly `context_only_not_exact_replay_binding`; registration alone does not prove they are the exact original replay input. Missing, unreadable or malformed market data returns an explicit unavailable reason rather than candles made from strategy fills.

`GET /api/results/{id}/fills` uses the same bounded UTC window and `limit` up to 1,000 plus an opaque cursor. Equal-timestamp fills remain separate, with segment-scoped IDs and original fill sequence. Execution `price` comes from the recorded accounting price (`quote_px`); triggering tape price and order limit remain separate. Physical fill time and private visibility time are distinct. Inventory before/after is the recorded local callback ledger, not an invented physical-order reconstruction. Signed fees preserve positive cost and negative rebate; they are already included in trading PnL. `inventory_lifecycle_id_at_submit` is not relabeled as the final inventory lifecycle ID.

`GET /api/results/{id}/orders/{order_id}` returns only snapshots saved at actual fills, with at most 1,000 fill rows and explicit truncation. Target quote proposals never become effective orders. Unfilled-order lifecycle, later cancel outcomes and order PnL are unavailable unless present in those original records; absent fields remain null and lifecycle completeness remains false. All fills and orders are labeled `simulated_historical_fills`, not live executions. The existing aggregate report remains the accounting view; chart queries do not manufacture a PnL curve.

## View existing data-quality evidence

The owner can adapt existing source/version audit CSVs and metadata-only file inventories into the calendar without downloading data, rerunning an audit or changing frozen replay inputs:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m narrowgate.studio_quality \
  --state-dir "${NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR}/studio-control" \
  --manifest "${NARROWGATE_PRIVATE_EVIDENCE_ROOT}/operator-selected.json"
```

The private manifest selects the source identity, existing audit columns and optional inventory patterns; the compact mapping is documented in [`import_quality`](../../narrowgate/studio_quality.py). It does not apply new quality thresholds. `GET /api/data-quality/catalog` lists registered datasets and nodes. `GET /api/data-quality?start_day=YYYY-MM-DD&end_day=YYYY-MM-DD` returns the complete inclusive calendar for at most 366 UTC days, optionally filtered by `dataset_id` and `node`. `/api/data-quality/export` uses the same parameters and exports only a suggested repair/synchronization list; it performs none of those operations.

The calendar separates four questions: what raw data or processed artifact is registered, which existing audit applies to the current canonical files, which uses that audit actually checks, and whether the selected node has the same version. Source `stage` is explicitly registered as `raw`, `processed` or unspecified; the UI does not guess from a path. An unobserved remote copy does not invalidate a canonical file's existing feature-input check, and an online machine does not verify its copy.

The current-use cards cover candles, feature input, modeled replay, strict queue replay and funding accounting. Each card includes its reason and scope. A feature-input pass is not label quality or training admission. Missing native sequence fields may limit strict queue reconstruction without disqualifying candles or feature work; those uses need their own recorded checks. Not applicable means the source does not serve that purpose, not that a download failed. Forward-filled continuity is not evidence that source messages were never lost.

Historical `check_status` and `task_usability` remain visible under the original report and timestamp; the current cards use `current_task_usability`. No recorded audit, an unbound historical report, changed files, an inaccessible mount and an unobserved remote replica have distinct explanations. An owner may associate an existing content audit with its registered artifact version and expected file sizes. A matching metadata refresh is labeled **existing audit associated; size match only**, not newly verified content. The UI never silently promotes an old pass or constructs a green interval from missing audit detail.

**Refresh registered local inventory** calls `POST /api/data-quality/refresh` with exactly `start_day`, `end_day`, `dataset_id` and `node`. It observes only the selected registered local file patterns or explicit files in the registered date range; an empty dataset selection means all registered datasets, independently of the browser's display-only source filters. It does not read raw content, calculate SHA, traverse unregistered directories, start downloads, run a quality calculation or rerun a baseline. It cannot refresh remote-copy verification timestamps. The response states whether refresh occurred, its scope and observation time; an absent refresh registration is explicit, not a successful audit. **Reload page** remains a separate read-only operation. Full source-specific normalization and quality work still uses the existing offline tools or a separately registered execution plan.

## One remote host first, then more workers

### Actual compute resources, separate from demo workers

Start the same control service with an optional owner-private resource manifest:

```bash
python -m narrowgate.studio serve \
  --state-dir "${NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR}/studio-control" \
  --resources-manifest "${NARROWGATE_PRIVATE_EVIDENCE_ROOT}/compute-resources.json" \
  --port 8080
```

The manifest has `visibility: local_only_do_not_publish` and a `resources` list. Each resource supplies a stable `id`, human-readable `label`, `kind` (`local`, `lan`, or `azure`), intended `roles` (`training`, `replay`, `data_processing`), and a fixed probe type. Local probes inspect the control host; SSH probes use an existing configured alias and interpreter; Azure Batch probes use the selected existing CLI context, account and pool. Addresses, account identifiers, local paths and credentials do not belong in public configuration or frontend source. Removing an Azure entry or selecting another authorized account requires configuration, not a new UI implementation.

`GET /api/compute-resources` reads a cached resource snapshot. The control service refreshes it in the background with bounded probes; an HTTP page request does not wait for SSH or Azure. The page shows friendly aliases, observed hardware and capacity, last-check time, stale/unreachable state and selected external job status. A zero-node Azure pool is registered capacity, not an online host. An unconfigured resource list stays empty; it never manufactures three online machines. Historical B0 execution origin is not a health probe.

Existing jobs can be observed through selected small status files and process checks. These are external jobs, not tasks owned by the Studio queue; the observer neither launches them nor reads partial economic results. Synthetic worker records remain available separately for demo diagnostics. Two demo processes on one Mac must not be counted as two physical resources. Role labels are placement guidance, not proof of a benchmark, a dataset replica or a ready real-market executor.

Choose placement using current load, usable memory, data locality, verified runtime compatibility and measured throughput. Prefer Mac M4 for training, while also allowing its registered spare capacity for replay/data preparation alongside suitable LAN/cloud resources. M4 does not imply that every model library uses Metal. Do not migrate active work by restarting it or duplicate a baseline to fill idle capacity. Dependent continuous shards stay ordered and may change hosts only through a compatible complete runtime checkpoint. The registered adapter below adds explicit plan submission, not arbitrary shell execution or automatic cloud provisioning. Existing external jobs remain read-only and are never taken over by that queue.

The working-set policy is rolling two-UTC-day shards, not a complete dataset replica on every worker. Include actual warmup, lookahead, pending checkpoint inputs, staging/decompression and output headroom in the capacity estimate. Verify and durably return outputs and continuation state before evicting reproducible unreferenced shard cache and taking the next ready shard. Independent arms or state-independent preparation tasks can run concurrently; consecutive pieces of one continuous arm cannot invent independent starting inventory/orders. The [existing replay checkpoint](../replay_runtime_checkpoint.md) supports bounded input rotation, but Studio does not yet automate data fetch, verified cache eviction or checkpoint-dependency scheduling. The current fixed-plan adapter must not be presented as that complete rolling scheduler.

```text
Browser ── HTTP over SSH tunnel ── Control API + local SQLite + published outputs
                                      ▲
                                      │ claim / heartbeat / publish over HTTP
                                  Worker process

                               canonical replay CLI
```

The browser talks HTTP, not SSH commands. On your workstation, forward the control host's loopback port:

```bash
ssh -NT -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes \
  -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 \
  -L 127.0.0.1:18080:127.0.0.1:8080 research@control-host
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:18080`. `control-host` is an operator-configured SSH alias, not a bundled server. The service intentionally listens only on loopback. Do not expose it by changing cloud firewall rules or binding to all interfaces.

For a worker on another host, establish an equivalent tunnel from that worker host to the control host, then point `--url` at its local forwarded port. Workers communicate through the API; they never mount or write the control SQLite file. The built-in demo dataset ships with each worker. Registered offline plans instead require the operator to prepare their exact worker-local inputs and runtime; Studio does not download data, substitute another feed or turn file existence into data-quality qualification.

## Queue an operator-registered offline plan

Use a reviewed owner-only execution manifest (`0600`, `visibility: local_only_do_not_publish`) on control and each execution host. The [`Catalog`](../../narrowgate/studio_execution.py) format defines resource roles and plans with stable `id`, `revision`, `role`, `targets` and an explicit `preferred_resources` order. A target fixes its Python argument list, working directory, required input files, output directory, required output names, small JSON summary names, available-memory requirement, timeout and optional conflicting-process check. Commands, environment values and local paths are never entered by the browser. This registration is an operational invocation contract, not a new research approval or hash hierarchy.

```bash
python -m narrowgate.studio serve \
  --state-dir "${NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR}/studio-control" \
  --resources-manifest "${NARROWGATE_PRIVATE_EVIDENCE_ROOT}/compute-resources.json" \
  --execution-manifest "${NARROWGATE_PRIVATE_EVIDENCE_ROOT}/execution-plans.json" \
  --port 8080

python -m narrowgate.studio worker \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --worker-id research-worker-a \
  --resource-id research-host-a \
  --execution-manifest "${NARROWGATE_PRIVATE_EVIDENCE_ROOT}/worker-execution-plans.json" \
  --work-dir "${NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR}/studio-research-worker"
```

The IDs are examples; configure the same logical resource and plan revision on control and its worker, with the correct local paths on each host. The old worker command without these options remains a synthetic-demo worker. Resource probes, offline worker heartbeats and observed external jobs are three separate signals in the UI.

In **计算资源**, choose an enabled plan and either one permitted resource or the plan's registered priority order. `GET /api/execution-plans` supplies choices, readiness and any existing `attempt`; `POST /api/executions` accepts exactly `plan_id` and `resource_id`, plus the existing `Idempotency-Key` header. There are no browser fields for shell, paths, strategy parameters, dates or credentials. One plan is one complete task: continuous days are not split between hosts. Retrying an identical request with its original idempotency key returns the original task. Submitting the same plan/revision with a different key returns HTTP 409, including after a failure, cancellation or lost worker. The UI disables duplicate submission and links to the existing task; it never silently reruns an economic plan.

Submitting and executing are distinct. An allowed target without a connected worker, sufficient available memory, required inputs or free execution capacity stays queued with a reason. Automatic selection retains every explicitly registered eligible target, including the Mac; it never invents an unregistered local fallback. An explicit resource request or `preferred_resources` list retains its declared scope and order. Without that list, training prioritizes the configured preferred training role and still rejects LAN training; replay/data placement follows registered target order. Azure with zero nodes stays unready and is not expanded by this adapter. A conflicting external process or an already-existing output directory prevents a new invocation; it is not adopted, overwritten or resumed.

The worker rechecks the target before running its fixed Python invocation, enforces the registered timeout, and validates required outputs before publishing. Original stdout/stderr and large result files remain on the worker's persistent disk. The control stores bounded terminal log tails (up to 256 KB each), registered JSON summaries (up to 256 KB each), output-file metadata and execution-environment metadata within the existing publication bound. Publication failure cannot become `completed`; the same worker retains the outbox for upload recovery without rerunning the computation. This archive is not a full backup of large output files; archive those through the existing owner workflow before releasing a cloud node.

The **任务队列** labels `operator_registered_offline` separately from `synthetic_non_economic`. A completed offline plan opens `registered_execution_report.v1`, showing only its registered summaries, artifact list, terminal logs and environment. It never enters demo order/trace charts or the synthetic comparison table. Empty summaries mean none were registered, not zero PnL. Execution completion is not economic validation, research promotion, exact live parity or complete host-crash recovery. New B0 or E/C runs still need the appropriate already-prepared canonical plan; merely registering a host does not create one.

The optional `NARROWGATE_STUDIO_TOKEN` environment variable enables Bearer authentication. Set the same operator-generated token on control and workers; the browser's “访问凭据” dialog keeps it only in page memory. Tokens must not appear in URLs or source control. With authentication the UI uses authenticated polling rather than putting tokens into an SSE URL. This is a single-owner SSH-tunnel service, not a public multi-user service.

## Process ownership and storage

Run control and worker as separate OS-managed services for unattended use. Do not attach their lifetime to an SSH shell. A minimal Linux user-service template for the worker is:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=NarrowGate synthetic replay worker
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=%h/narrowgate
ExecStart=%h/narrowgate/.venv/bin/python -m narrowgate.studio worker --url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --worker-id worker-a --work-dir %h/narrowgate/results/studio-worker-a
Restart=no
KillMode=control-group
TimeoutStopSec=20

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Adapt installation paths once. Use a separate control unit with the `serve` command and a separately supervised tunnel where needed. `KillMode=control-group` matters: a forcibly killed bare worker may otherwise leave its independent replay child alive. Normal worker termination sends TERM, waits, then kills and reaps its child if necessary. A host reboot or forced kill is not a resumable economic checkpoint; preserve the old task and inspect its process/logs before deciding what to do next.

Keep the control state directory and worker work directories on durable private storage. SQLite is local to the control host, not a shared network database. Published outputs are stored with that database. Worker scratch and outboxes must not be deleted while a job is running, uncertain or awaiting upload. A cloud temporary disk disappearing also removes any unuploaded artifacts; a browser reconnection cannot recover them. This first release has no automatic cloud-resource provisioning, Blob lifecycle or deletion action.

## Failure semantics

| Event | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Double-click or lost submit response | The same `Idempotency-Key` and request return the original experiment. A different request with that key is rejected. |
| Lost worker claim response | Reusing the worker's persisted session resolves to its original unfinished job, never a second job. |
| Browser/SSH disconnect | The control queue and worker process remain independent of the browser. |
| Temporary control outage | Network/5xx retries are bounded. A running child is not immediately killed solely because the API is unavailable. |
| Missed heartbeat | The task is `lost`, not automatically failed or requeued. Only its original worker/session can reconnect and publish. |
| Cancel queued task | It becomes canceled without executing the runner. |
| Cancel running task | `cancel_requested` remains until the worker terminates/reaps the process and publishes its terminal logs. |
| Cancel races with successful computation | Cancellation wins before result publication; logs are preserved, but no completed report is admitted. |
| Upload failure | No completed state. The exact publication payload and logs remain in the worker directory; restarting the same worker resumes that upload, not the computation. |
| Worker restarts with an existing execution directory but no outbox | Stops with an explicit uncertain-execution error. It cannot safely infer that the old child is dead or start a duplicate. |
| Repeated publication | Identical same-attempt publication is idempotent; changed or other-attempt content cannot overwrite a terminal result. |

For synthetic jobs, the control marks a result completed only after required summary, trace, receipt, stdout, stderr and environment information have been saved and synchronized, and the database transaction commits. Registered offline jobs use their own output contract and bounded publication described above, not synthetic reference bytes. Reference bytes are checked once when synthetic output enters the result store, not on every chart read. No additional research SHA/permission hierarchy is created.

Demo execution has a 600-second worker-enforced timeout and a bounded upload size. Running logs currently remain on the worker; the browser shows terminal archived logs, not a live stdout stream. Task progress is lifecycle status, not an invented completion percentage.

## Result and accounting contract

The display-only `backtest_report.v1` wrapper retains the original `summary.json` and ordered `trace.jsonl`. It is not research authority. The UI reads existing cash, inventory, fees, inventory lifecycle and terminal PnL fields; it does not recalculate them. Missing fields remain unknown. All three demo orders are displayed, including the unfilled canceled order.

Real-market adapters must preserve these boundaries before being enabled:

- `replay_pnl` already includes trading fees; do not subtract fees twice. Funding must be separately reported and included exactly once in the primary net value.
- A continuous segment summary is not one observation per UTC day. Reuse the canonical continuous ledger's daily slices rather than labeling the entire segment as its first day.
- A PnL ledger beginning at zero is not funded account equity. Do not fabricate returns, annualized performance or a capital-scaled Sharpe ratio.
- Queue positions and counterfactual fills are modeled. Matching two hosts proves implementation reproducibility, not exact exchange queue or live-economic equivalence.
- Compare only complete compatible environments. Preserve each arm's own orders, inventory, funding, endogenous gateway queue and RNG state; a common seed alone is insufficient to prove shared exogenous latency draws.
- Real event queries need bounded time/order/inventory_lifecycle windows. Any chart decimation must not change original event order, accounting or statistical calculations.

## Remaining delivery sequence

| Workstream | Current status / next acceptance |
| --- | --- |
| Public onboarding | Product-first no-account demo; worked order example; data-state table; research status separated from tooling availability. |
| Remote execution foundation | Durable queue, independent workers, cancel/lost states and output publication support demo and optional operator-registered offline plans; no automatic cloud provisioning. |
| Current B0 integration | Completed private B0 summaries remain read-only. A new B0 run requires a separately registered canonical plan; existing external baselines are not taken over or repeated. |
| E/C research | The separate research branch collects complete E/C opportunities and assembles single-intervention paired labels. This does not yet constitute a trained or validated selection policy. |
| Real dataset registry | Generic data browsing/substitution is not execution readiness. The owner prepares a plan's exact Development inputs, splits and runtime using existing canonical tools; required-file checks do not replace data-quality or causal checks. |
| Bounded real execution | Fixed registered Python plans, target roles, input/memory/output checks, timeout and bounded terminal publication are implemented. Full large-artifact replication and an arbitrary experiment editor are not. |
| Full analysis | Reuse existing inventory lifecycle, funding, scorecard and chronological statistics. Add real trace pagination, source-aware latency views and compatibility explanations. |
| Multi-host qualification | Verify the packaged service, SSH tunnels, node loss and original finalizer acceptance on target hosts before declaring remote real-market readiness. |

The current research work remains independent of this UI. Do not train/select strategies from incomplete baseline segments, start duplicate Azure baselines, restart live, or read sealed outcomes to make the interface look populated.

## Checks

```bash
python -m pip install ".[studio,dev]"
python -m pytest tests/test_replay_studio.py tests/test_public_replay_demo.py tests/test_public_onboarding.py
python -m ruff check narrowgate examples --select E,F,I,UP,B
```

The Studio tests exercise concurrent claims, idempotency, control-store reopening, lost/canceled workers, artifact failures, original demo CLI execution and loopback/API boundaries. Registered-plan tests must also cover forbidden placement, unavailable resources staying queued, fixed-output conflicts, process ownership and non-demo report classification. They are not native queue qualification, an economic backtest or proof of arbitrary host-crash recovery. Browser verification should use a harmless registered offline check, confirm plan-only submission and classification, then verify the unchanged synthetic order/inventory_lifecycle flow. Unknown plans and live launchers remain unavailable through the UI.
