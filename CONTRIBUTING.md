Thank you for helping improve NarrowGateMaker. This repository combines ordinary
software engineering with evidence-governed market-making research, so the review
path depends on what a change claims.

Start with the [goal-oriented contributor guide](docs/opensource/README.md). This is
a source-available project under the [PolyForm Noncommercial License](LICENSE),
which permits the noncommercial purposes stated in its terms and restricts
commercial use. A pull request does not grant commercial-use permission.

## Choose the Right Path

| Goal | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Report a reproducible code bug | Use the GitHub bug report form |
| Propose a feature or mechanics change | Use the GitHub feature request form |
| Correct or clarify public documentation | Use the documentation report form |
| Propose or publish research evidence | Read the [research evidence PR rules](docs/opensource/research_contributions.md), then use the research evidence form |
| Report a vulnerability | Follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); do not open a detailed public issue |
| Ask about commercial authorization | Use the public commercial-license issue form; no dedicated licensing email is published |

For a substantial change, open an issue before investing in an implementation.
Keep one pull request focused on one reviewable goal.

## Development Workflow

1. Branch from the current maintained public branch.
2. Make the smallest change that resolves the stated problem.
3. Add or update tests in proportion to the behavioral risk.
4. Run the relevant checks from [Developer Checks](docs/dev/ci.md); maintainers also preserve the exact [branch-protection check names](docs/dev/ci.md#branch-protection).
5. Inspect the complete diff for privacy, evidence, and authority claims.
6. Open a pull request using the repository template.

Ordinary code, build, test, and documentation changes follow this workflow. A bug
fix does not become a new research result merely because it affects a research
executor.

Build release wheels from a clean source checkout or temporary source tree. An old
`build/lib` directory can retain deleted modules and copy them into a later wheel;
do not treat its contents as maintained source. Test the installed wheel outside
the checkout, including its required package resources.

## Research Identity and Formal Execution

Research identity and execution identity are separate. A research identity changes
only when at least one frozen scientific-contract element changes:

- sample;
- baseline or candidate ladder;
- folds;
- estimand;
- statistical contract.

An implementation bug, crash, cache mismatch, concurrency race, serialization error, or performance repair stays under the same research identity while those scientific-contract elements remain unchanged. It must not be renamed as a new research `vXX`. An ordinary code review needs proportionate software checks, not a new economic study. When the repaired executor is used for another formal run, record a new execution attempt with the actual tested source and input identities; do not overwrite the failed attempt or reuse its partial economics.

The formal sequence is:

```text
development branch
-> stability gates
-> exact tested clean commit
-> annotated execution tag
-> SHA-bound pre-run manifest with an attempt-* identity
-> formal execution
-> immutable final receipt binding result hashes to the pre-run manifest
```

The formal study's execution contract defines its required stability checks: representative single-day output, fold/input coverage, concurrency and cache durability, regression/parity, output-shape smoke, and the exact source identity. Apply each check at the boundary it verifies. Documentation-only changes do not require full market replay; a targeted runtime repair needs focused regressions and the affected backend/state-machine checks. Before publishing new formal economics, verify the study's required execution topology, inputs, and output completeness. Reuse prior checks only when their tested inputs and behavior are unchanged and the study contract permits it.

A failed formal run receives an immutable failed-attempt receipt and is ineligible for economic inference. Repair it on the development line, document the impact and validation scope, then issue a new `attempt-*` identity for the next formal run. Preserve any stricter checks required by that run's already-frozen contract; do not silently weaken historical evidence requirements. Do not move, rewrite, or delete the failed tag, manifest, or receipt.

See the [formal execution contract](research/shared/experiment_governance/docs/formal_execution_attempt_and_evidence_freeze_contract_v1_20260821.md)
and the [identity guide](docs/opensource/identity_and_release.md) for the full
boundary.

## Public Contribution Boundary

Do not commit or paste any of the following into an issue, pull request, test
fixture, screenshot, log, or document:

- personal absolute paths or physical storage locations;
- private hostnames, IP addresses, SSH targets, cloud or account identifiers, or
  process identifiers;
- credentials, tokens, environment files, signing material, or secret-bearing
  configuration;
- private datasets, licensed source bytes, owner-side evidence, raw live account
  state, positions, orders, or fills;
- generated reports that disclose a private locator even when the report itself is
  otherwise harmless.

Use the placeholders from [Path Conventions](docs/path_conventions.md). A SHA256 is
verification metadata, not a downloadable location. Every referenced artifact must
be linked to public bytes or explicitly marked with its honest availability, such
as `private_not_distributed`. Never invent a link or substitute current bytes for a
missing frozen artifact.

Public research material must stand on its own without access to an owner's machine.
Read the [public/private documentation contract](docs/public_private_documentation_contract.md)
and [public research evidence layout](docs/public_private_documentation_contract.md#evidence-owners-and-local-catalogs) before adding an
evidence artifact.

## Pull Request Expectations

Every pull request should state:

- the problem and the behavioral change;
- the files and authority surfaces affected;
- tests and public documentation audits run;
- whether the change is ordinary engineering, a new execution attempt under an
  unchanged research identity, or a changed scientific contract;
- artifact availability and evidence permissions, when research is involved;
- any remaining limitation or intentionally unavailable private dependency.

Research evidence pull requests have additional requirements in the
[research evidence guide](docs/opensource/research_contributions.md). Neither a
merged pull request nor a passing research run grants action or live authority.

## Documentation Audit

For any public documentation or machine-readable record change, run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/audit_public_documentation.py --repo-root .
git diff --check
```

The public audit must report zero findings. Public contributors are not expected or
authorized to inspect the owner-private evidence store.
