Evidence availability: SHA256 values below are identity metadata, not download links. Repository-relative links identify files available in this repository. Unless the surrounding text identifies a public repository source or release, a named artifact without a public link is owner-side evidence retained in the private evidence store and is not distributed with the public repository.

> Current status (2026-07-27): retain the actual EC2 fill/inventory_lifecycle component as historical descriptive evidence only. Exact Development replay add-toxicity, repair-delay, distance, cap-hit, inventory lifecycle and PnL values used the superseded top-20/q0.70 and model/book identity and remain withdrawn. Live observations and replay values must not be combined into a causal action conclusion; a replay successor requires a newly frozen current denominator.

## Status

This audit is observational attribution under the current operational baseline. It does not change live policy and it does not identify action uplift.

## Frozen live decomposition

The exact live window contains 508 closed inventory lifecycle and 1,556 fills in those closed inventory_lifecycles. One final fill opened a censored inventory lifecycle and is excluded.

| Group | inventory lifecycle | Terminal PnL | Mean PnL | Median duration |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| No add | 408 | +0.3122 | +0.0008 | 89.8s |
| At least one add | 100 | -9.3668 | -0.0937 | 509.4s |
| Worst 20 | 20 | -8.7043 | -0.4352 | 689.8s |

The labels `no_add_net_positive` and `add_net_negative` describe each group's aggregate outcome. They do not claim that every member has the same sign.

## Dynamic mechanism transmission

### Regime and P3

Regime scaling is active rather than nominal:

- Live inventory lifecycle mean scale: about `1.53x`.
- Development inventory lifecycle mean scale: about `1.81x`.
- Development add inventory lifecycle: about `1.63x`.

The P3 pair-spread floor binds materially, but it does not dominate every decision:

- Live sampled inventory lifecycle rate: `28.9%`.
- Development all-inventory_lifecycle rate: `11.3%`.
- Development no-add rate: `8.7%`.
- Development add rate: `23.0%`.

This means low-volatility tightening is sometimes removed by P3, especially in add inventory lifecycle, but the mechanism is not permanently pinned to the floor.

### Effective kappa and depth ratio

The Development inventory lifecycle mean `kappa_used` is `0.067449`, versus empirical P3 `0.067438`. The average ratio is `1.00016`. Live is similarly close to one.

Depth kappa therefore has almost no ordinary-state action range under the current baseline. Rare states move it, but it is not a meaningful continuous controller for most inventory_lifecycles.

### Dynamic cap

The cap level itself moves:

- Live mean cap: `24.52 bps`.
- Development mean cap: `31.72 bps`.
- Development add inventory lifecycle: `27.21 bps`.

It is almost never binding:

- Live sampled cap-hit rate: `0%`.
- Development cap-hit/final-compress rate: about `0.24%`.
- Development add-inventory_lifecycle rate: about `0.08%`.

The current dynamic cap is therefore an operational ceiling, not a material source of inventory lifecycle adaptation.

### Cooldown and quote geometry

The live cooldown samples show the expected staircase rather than a smooth adaptive mechanism:

- `85s`: 3 inventory lifecycle maxima
- `170s`: 61
- `255s`: 30
- `340s`: 8
- `425s`: 2

Development has the same `85/170/255/...` structure. Median maximum cooldown is `170s` for add inventory lifecycle and rises to roughly `319s` in the worst 20.

Development add inventory lifecycle have mean add distance `3.85 -> 4.27 bps` from base to final. Reducing distance is `3.35 -> 3.73 bps`. The reducing side is often widened by common overlays, but actual defense pause is rare: inventory_lifecycle-mean reducing pause rate is below `0.1%`.

## Add toxicity versus repair failure

For attribution only, the audit predeclares:

- immediate add toxicity: first-add 30s maker-signed markout `<= -0.5 bps`;
- repair failure: more than `300s` from first add to first reducing fill.

These thresholds are diagnostics, not treatment definitions.

### Live 48h

| Add class | inventory lifecycle | Terminal PnL |
|---|---:|---:|
| Immediate toxicity only | 43 | -4.0939 |
| Repair failure only | 11 | -1.6059 |
| Mixed | 5 | -2.0747 |
| Other add | 41 | -1.5923 |

The 100 add inventory lifecycle have first-add 30s markout averaging about `-0.82 bps`. SHORT add inventory lifecycle are worse in this window (`-1.03 bps`, `-5.9967` terminal PnL) than LONG add inventory lifecycle (`-0.61 bps`, `-3.3701`). This is a two-day diagnostic, not a stable side claim.

### Development56

| Add class | inventory lifecycle | Terminal PnL |
|---|---:|---:|
| Immediate toxicity only | 672 | -104.6215 |
| Repair failure only | 280 | -23.8250 |
| Mixed | 303 | -40.7765 |
| Other add | 623 | -8.8760 |

All 1,878 add inventory lifecycle sum to `-178.099`, while 8,496 no-add inventory lifecycle sum to `+11.039`. The first-add 30s markout averages about `-1.01 bps`. This association does not identify the value of skipping an add because action changes fill, queue, and the subsequent inventory lifecycle path.

## Reducing-side repair support gate

The support probe uses the baseline reducing price and individual execution trades. A touch or strict trade-through is not treated as a queue fill counterfactual.

| Inventory side | Defense-pause inventory lifecycle | Active days | Pause intervals | Duration | Strict through | Affected negative-add rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LONG / SELL reducing | 74 | 31 | 252 | 1,647.95s | 14 | 3.46% |
| SHORT / BUY reducing | 68 | 38 | 148 | 894.81s | 10 | 6.00% |

The predeclared gate required at least 50 inventory lifecycle, 10 days, 20 strict-through intervals, and 5% affected negative-add inventory lifecycle per side. Neither side passes all four conditions. The live window is even thinner: five pause intervals across three inventory lifecycle, with one strict trade-through.

The inventory emergency threshold is also inactive. `0.5 * 0.026 = 0.013 BTC`, while the observed maximum is `0.007 BTC` live and `0.012 BTC` in Development. The loss-based emergency override does activate in one Development tail inventory lifecycle, so the two emergency paths must not be conflated.

## Decision

`reducing_repair_release_v1` is closed at the support stage. It is not generated, tested, or promoted, and live defense remains unchanged.

The next action family should target the first baseline-eligible exposure-increasing add opportunity, not the realized first add fill:

- `A0`: baseline add quote cycle;
- `A1`: skip exactly one add quote cycle;
- BUY and SELL evaluated separately;
- one 50/50 randomized intervention per inventory lifecycle;
- reducing quote, size, inventory limit, and taker behavior unchanged;
- full queue, latency, fill, and inventory lifecycle continuation replay;
- reward is decision-to-terminal MTM with inventory lifecycle cost, repair time, tail, and activity reported separately.

This family must first pass an action-support preflight. The observational losses above are the reason to test it, not evidence that `A1` is profitable.
