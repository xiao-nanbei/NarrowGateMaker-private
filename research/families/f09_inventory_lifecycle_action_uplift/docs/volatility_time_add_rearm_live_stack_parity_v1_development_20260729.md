Evidence availability: SHA256 values below are identity metadata, not download links. Repository-relative links identify files available in this repository. Unless the surrounding text identifies a public repository source or release, a named artifact without a public link is owner-side evidence retained in the private evidence store and is not distributed with the public repository.

Owner-side data and machine artifacts are in the private evidence store and are not distributed with this repository unless a repository-relative link is provided. See the [public/private documentation contract](../../../../docs/public_private_documentation_contract.md).

Status: Development-only mechanics/parity completed; randomized action held.

This identity replaces v2.1's unbound blocker booleans with hash-bound source, artifact, event-tape, latency, test, and Python/C++ evidence. It reads no reward, PnL, markout, Validation, or sealed holdout.

## Result

- Decision: `hold_action_candidate_path_and_cpp_q90_parity_incomplete`.
- Variance-time clock mechanics: supported.
- Full live-stack parity: not supported.
- Offline randomized-action replay: not yet supported.
- AWS receive-time transport: not established; retained as a separate live authorization gate and not treated as an irrecoverable offline blocker.
- Live authorization: false.
- `unmasked_action_effective_rate`: undefined until the candidate regenerates the complete strategy path.

The predecessor's BUY 69.8% and SELL 61.6% rates remain only mechanical timing change rates at the 5-second threshold. They do not mean that six or seven in ten final quote actions change.

## Parity Cells

| Control | Result | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Variance-clock integrator | pass | Isolated clock kernel only |
| Same-side reducing fill deadline | pass | Preserves the absolute active add-cooldown deadline |
| Consecutive-loss cooldown | pass | Reward-path-dependent Python/C++ state machine |
| Sync-degrade frozen tape | pass for mechanics | Full-day bound tape has zero observed trigger; trigger behavior is synthetic parity evidence |
| BUY q90 cancel/ACK/recovery/re-entry | fail | Python supported; C++ lacks the native snapshot/delta scheduler and exact-level scorer |
| Variance-time full candidate path | fail | Candidate timing does not yet regenerate orders, fills, inventory, queue, and downstream blockers |

## State And Data Identity

All 40 Development target-day BBO files and the 40 D-1 warmup files are hash-bound. Of 22,854 source fill rows, 22,738 are safely reconstructible after the second within-day side transition, a 99.4924% rate. All 40 days have a safe within-day anchor, so daily fresh-start mechanics are supported. Continuous live lineage remains unsupported because prior-day counters and cooldown deadlines were not restored.

The frozen sync tape covers the full 2026-07-20 UTC day and is bound to its source live log. It contains zero observed sync-degrade triggers. This is valid zero-event coverage, not evidence that the trigger path occurred in that live window.

## Authority

The future intervention unit remains one same-side cooldown lineage until an opposite fill or explicit reset. No single fill episode or ordinary inventory lifecycle assignment is authorized. Historical exact AWS receive timestamps are not required to run a future offline randomized replay with a frozen latency distribution; AWS receive-time transport and shadow parity remain mandatory before live authorization.
