This entrypoint fits small action-value models from already-validated modeled counterfactual labels. It does not launch replay, fetch private data, claim live fill identity, or deploy a strategy. A successful fit is not evidence of profit.

## Current Tardis preparation (2026-09-27)

`F05-prefill-EC-Tardis-v1` uses the owner's explicitly selected `D_g050_a010` baseline (three linked coefficients 0.05, asymmetry 0.1, ML on) and visible-inventory selection. This choice on 2026-09-27 precedes real E/C labels and fitting; all parent and evaluation paths share it. Historical 0.05/0 results retain their identities. Its budget and actual stage are recorded in the existing `research/recompute_407.json` F05 entry; this offline choice does not change production live.

The shared-input replay now accepts an explicit `execution_end_ns`, actually limits the event clock, binds that endpoint in ordinary checkpoint restoration, and emits a completed bounded-execution window. `settle_public_replay()` requires that window before settling a shorter interval. `funding_window()` selects the exact `(start, end]` schedule from an already bound, complete parent funding input. Frozen input manifests remain unchanged; default full-account execution is unchanged.

`assemble_prefill_label()` consumes the two authoritative accounting results, common-prefix/cut evidence and one intervention. Its distinct `prefill_ec_accounting_30000ms.v1` contract fixes the outcome at decision plus 30000ms and subtracts all-in PnL once, including fees and funding. Pending notifications do not invalidate complete economic matching facts. The trainer selects this contract explicitly with `--label-contract prefill_ec_accounting_30000ms.v1 --alpha 1 --min-train-rows 128`; historical labels are not converted or silently mixed. `prefill_features()` supplies the shared unit/sign transformation. Eight visible features were frozen before real outcomes; the unavailable exact 5000ms trade-imbalance and adverse-mid-change inputs are excluded, not filled or approximated.

`simulate_prefill_branch()` resumes an earlier same-input B0 checkpoint, validates the exact opportunity ID/sequence/order at the pre-order/budget phase, changes only POST/WAIT or KEEP/CANCEL once, and stops before the first event at or after the 30000ms endpoint. Normal restore still rejects changed parameters, predictions or end bounds. Controlled tests cover E and C, repeated same-action clones, reversed branch order and preserving the untouched parent. The first 32 real pairs (eight per surface) have complete paired settlement; same-state/same-action and same-T no-fork controls have zero difference. This is label engineering evidence, not a fitted-policy profit result or real cross-midnight branch test.

Replay explicitly selects `risk_selection_feature_contract=prefill_visible_market_5000ms.v1` with `visible_inventory`. Replay and the live candidate adapter map visible book quantities, BBO, variance rate, remaining ownership and local submission time through the shared transform; historical own-fill/toxicity inputs are not part of this map. Controlled E/C checkpoint tests verify that collection alone leaves baseline fills, cash and inventory unchanged.

`terminal_valuations()` prepares multiple exclusive endpoints in one delivered-depth pass. Both branches may pass the same immutable `TerminalValuation` to `settle_public_replay()`, which binds input, endpoint and age policy without rescanning depth. Selection retains `ready < T`, source age and invalid/stale-book behavior; it never borrows an older valid book. Tests compare direct selection across batch boundaries and prove paired settlement performs no depth I/O after preparation.

`python -m research.families.f05_fill_quality_quote_ev.prefill_labels --task TASK.json` advances a declared parent and settles suffixes immediately. The task binds inputs, baseline, funding, frozen features, quota and time spacing. `--resume-from STAGE --output NEW_STAGE` continues the retained parent and charges previously selected pairs to the quota; it does not replay their prefix. `complete_parent=true` retains the full opportunity stream and settles the parent to its original endpoint. `sample_start_ns` spreads subsequent selection over deterministic time strata without consulting outcomes. Outputs preserve accounting and producer evidence separately.

The candidate live configuration uses restart-only `prefill_ec_mode=off|shadow|enforce`, `prefill_ec_scope=E|C|EC` and an explicit policy path. Enabled modes require matching baseline coefficients, feature units and model surfaces. Tests drive actual MakerEngine and OrderManager with a recording-only transport: WAIT creates no ownership, CANCEL follows normal pending/terminal handling, and off/shadow preserve baseline orders across Python/native planning paths. No trading connection or production activation was performed. Full label production, four fixed fits, real trained-policy assembly and economic evaluation remain outstanding.

## Historical September 7 pilot

The owner-authorized [first Development evidence package](risk_selection_development_20260907/README.md) publishes the actual research-only fit, all 43 training labels, all 18 later labels, separate horizon checks and complete-arm summaries. E changed actions but did not beat the reused B0; C selected no cancellations. It is a compact disclosure, not a bundled live model or a self-contained raw-market replay dataset.

## Historical pilot sequence

1. Keep the current baseline, execution environment and Development dates fixed.
2. Use the existing F01 replay with `--save-risk-opportunities` to retain every eligible opportunity, including those that never fill. Select targets by a rule fixed before outcomes, not by eventual fills or losses.
3. Use `--risk-pair-baseline-arm` and single-opportunity arm overrides. Validate the common opportunity prefix, one changed action, complete future trajectory, common terminal mark, fees and funding. The current implementation reruns prefixes; it does not claim complete checkpoint or copy-on-write restoration.
4. Only then fit the model, separately for E/BUY, E/SELL, C/BUY and C/SELL.
5. Evaluate the resulting B/E/C/EC policies on complete out-of-sample paths before considering any economic or deployment conclusion. Random participation and flat controls remain necessary; one-step labels cannot replace this study.

E compares POST minus WAIT for a permitted flat opener. A trained E model requires strictly positive value to POST; at zero it waits. C compares KEEP minus CANCEL for a remaining exposure-increasing order and cancels only for negative value. Absent models or unavailable features preserve the existing baseline protections. Neither action supplies a new price, size, cooldown, or immediate replacement.

## Minimal offline command

The files below are owner-provided artifacts, not files distributed by this repo. Run from the repository with the research dependencies installed:

```bash
PYTHON="$NARROWGATE_ROOT/.venv/bin/python"
"$PYTHON" -c 'import sys; assert sys.version_info >= (3, 11)'
"$PYTHON" -m research.families.f05_fill_quality_quote_ev.risk_selection_training \
  --labels "$NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR/pairs.risk_paired_labels.jsonl" \
  --feature-units "$NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR/feature_units.json" \
  --validation-start-ns "$VALIDATION_START_NS" \
  --alpha 1 --min-train-rows 8 --policy-id development-ec-ridge \
  --output-dir "$NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR/training"
```

`feature_units.json` explicitly maps frozen feature names to their units. The model uses those fields as recorded; it does not guess units or replace missing values with zeros. Feature choice and Ridge alpha must be fixed before validation results. Eight rows is a configurable engineering minimum, not a statistical sample-size recommendation or economic threshold.

Training means and scales use training rows only. Labels whose outcome reaches the validation boundary are purged. The same order cannot occur in both sets. No random row split is provided: many opportunities can share one market path and terminal value. A one-window pilot can verify fitting but cannot supply an independent validation period.

The report also describes each surface's training outcome-window count, UTC decision-hour coverage and per-feature distinct values/range/constant status, including surfaces too sparse to fit. Empty support is unknown, not a zero-valued feature. These fields do not alter selection, normalization, thresholds or fitting. An opener's inventory and a fixed order quantity can both be constant, so three named inputs may provide only one varying signal. Concentrated training hours or a missing side call for broader outcome-blind Development opportunity coverage, not a lower support threshold or a refit on the evaluated period. A participation control with probabilities zero or one is deterministic on that surface; report that explicitly instead of calling it randomized evidence.

`policy.json` is loadable by `strategy.risk_selection.RiskSelectionPolicy`. `training_report.json` records exclusions, per-surface support, prediction MSE against a past-only intercept, and whether a surface is training-only. Unsupported surfaces are absent from the policy, not silently pooled with another side. The output directory is new and private; existing artifacts are not overwritten.

## Complete learned-policy replay

After fitting, keep the existing frozen F01 baseline command and add `--risk-selection-policy "$NARROWGATE_RESULTS_DIR/training/policy.json"`. The command must use the Python diagnostic path, an explicit funding tape and `--continuous`; do not split consecutive days into fresh-start arms. Select B/E/C/EC through the existing arm-spec JSON, for example:

```json
[
  {"name": "E", "group": "risk_selection", "overrides": {"risk_selection_mode": "E"}},
  {"name": "C", "group": "risk_selection", "overrides": {"risk_selection_mode": "C"}},
  {"name": "EC", "group": "risk_selection", "overrides": {"risk_selection_mode": "EC"}}
]
```

Select these names alongside `baseline` using `--arms`. The policy file is read once before market loading; all arms share its payload and the same immutable inputs but own their orders, budgets, inventory and future actions. B remains the default and does not score. E/C/EC score both sides from one visible snapshot before reserving submission budget. WAIT adds no cooldown; C uses normal cancel/ACK/terminal handling.

This mode automatically retains the complete opportunity table with policy ID, predicted USDC difference and reason. The economic rows report selected actions, changes and fallback counts alongside net PnL and funding. A missing surface remains baseline, not a hidden transfer from the opposite side. Do not combine this mode with `--risk-pair-baseline-arm`: overlapping intervention labels are not full-policy returns. C++ execution and live deployment are not enabled by this switch.

## Random participation and Flat controls

The same F01 arm overrides select `risk_selection_control=learned` (the default), `random`, or `flat`. These controls use the existing opportunity collector and normal order path; the older random-passive cadence/quote-geometry arms are not matched-participation controls. Freeze the comparison design before evaluation outcomes; the implementation does not supply scientifically calibrated veto rates.

For R, use mode E, C or EC, the same `--risk-selection-policy` reference artifact, `risk_selection_random_rates` mapping surfaces such as `E:BUY` and `C:SELL` to WAIT/CANCEL probabilities in `[0,1]`, an explicit integer `risk_selection_random_seed`, and a nonempty `risk_selection_random_scope`. Estimate rates only from the frozen training period and keep seed, scope and rates fixed during evaluation. The reference scorer is actually evaluated to retain exactly its model/feature support, but its value does not select the random action. Missing model inputs, models or veto rates preserve baseline and are counted explicitly; a partially covered R arm must not be described as a complete four-surface matched control.

Random draws are keyed by seed, scope and opportunity identity and do not advance market, execution or latency random-number generators. Matching a training veto probability does not guarantee equal realized participation after paths diverge. Report actual decisions, vetoes, fallback mass and activity by side and E/C surface; do not retune the probability to the evaluation path.

For Flat, set `risk_selection_control=flat` and `risk_selection_mode=E`. Start from the same known flat, no-pending-order segment state and WAIT at every eligible E opportunity throughout the segment. Flat does not merely skip the first submission, reset an existing account or force liquidation. Nonflat or pending initial ownership is unsupported. It does not use the value model, including when other arms share a policy artifact.

Both controls require the Python diagnostic path, `--continuous` and explicit funding, automatically retain complete opportunities, and cannot share single-intervention labels. Opportunity values are null and reasons identify the control. Daily `risk_selection_control_*` counters are separate from the zero `risk_selection_policy_*` action/decision counters; `risk_selection_reference_evaluation_count` and `risk_selection_reference_policy_id` disclose R's actual reference-model work and are zero/empty for Flat. R's null value is not a claim that no model was computed. Neither control changes price, size, cadence, quantity-role safety checks, budget ownership or cancel terminal handling. Flat and other zero-activity controls cannot establish selective-execution success.

## Remaining scope

The present trainer checks label structure and arithmetic, not the original raw market inputs. Real paired-trajectory validation must precede its use. Queue and latency remain modeled, funding uses the frozen tape, and a shortened pilot uses common terminal MTM rather than realized-only reward. Labels are USDC per action, not probabilities, additive portfolio returns, or evidence of an optimal size.

Checkpoint branching and the recording-only live adapter are implemented within the scope above. A measured serialized runtime copy is not a peak-memory bound or a live-latency result. A policy JSON does not establish economic value or production readiness.
