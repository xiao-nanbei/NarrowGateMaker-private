## Dual-Path Decision

The frozen `conditional_p3_joint_quote_value_preflight_v1` hard gate remains failed and immutable:

```text
hard_gate_path.passed = false
owner_progression_path.support_accepted = true
```

The owner accepted the observed `28 days / 3 folds / 1 minimum cell fill` support and authorized an outcome-informed Development continuation. This did not relabel the original `30 days / 4 folds / 30 fills` gate as passed.

## Owner-Path Result

The successor reconstructed direct quantity-weighted, single-side baseline-terminal overlay deltas for the frozen 13-action joint quote set. Of 282 paired buckets, 269 had complete value support. Three expanding chronological folds produced 126 OOF buckets over 13 days.

No non-baseline action passed the past-only day-clustered simultaneous screen:

| Item | Result |
|---|---:|
| Supported action-fold cells | 0 |
| OOF candidate selections | 0 / 126 |
| OOF baseline fallback | 100% |
| OOF selected-value mean | 0 USDC/bucket |

The largest early-fold point estimate was `BUY farther 4 ticks` at about `+3.7e-5 USDC/bucket`; its simultaneous lower bound was about `+1.6e-5`, still below the frozen `1e-4 USDC/bucket` economic threshold. In the later two folds the same action's lower bounds crossed zero.

Decision:

```text
owner_proxy_signal_not_supported_stop_before_action_identity
```

## Estimand Boundary

This was a full-information proxy diagnostic using F06's frozen baseline inventory_lifecycle-terminal overlay. It did not regenerate the complete action-dependent inventory, cooldown, queue, or inventory lifecycle path and did not identify cross-side interactions. It therefore cannot authorize an F09 action even if a proxy point estimate is positive.

Both governance paths remain capable of reaching live in general. A standard hard-gate successor would use `research_supported_promotion`; a future owner successor with positive full-path economics and execution/safety parity would use `owner_risk_accepted_promotion`. This exact owner branch stops because the economic proxy produced no supported candidate.

Validation and sealed holdout were not read. No action or live permission was created.
