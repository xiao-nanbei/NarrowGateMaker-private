## Question

This family retained the placement estimand:

\[
P(T_{fill}\le t,\ T_{fill}<T_{cancelACK}
\mid current\ placement,x_0,baseline\ policy\ path).
\]

It did not inherit the v5 trailing role offsets or the v6 role/cause Platt maps. Cancel request was replayed as the frozen baseline policy stopping time; request-to-ACK latency was fitted separately on past-only data; partial and full fills remained possible until ACK.

This v1 artifact is policy-path-conditioned offline evidence. It is not an online cancel-request forecast and cannot score KEEP or REPLACE.

The empirical active-order report cuts were 5.010s, 5.801s, and 7.801s. The p99 fitted support was 34.9s. The 1s/5s/10s cuts remain diagnostics only.

## Lifecycle Audit

Policy-request parity passed:

- 625,845 cancel requests and 625,619 ACKs;
- zero ACK-without-request, ACK-before-request, missing reason, or timestamp mismatch against the baseline replay;
- 198 pending-cancel fill rows, totaling 0.198 BTC, were retained;
- 53 requests preceded the local activation ACK and were retained as valid in-flight-new-order races;
- 99.85% of requests were scheduled `requote_replace`; 941 were path triggers.

The request-to-ACK latency distribution had p25/p50/p75 of 6/7/9ms, p95 of 28ms, and p99 of 90ms.

## Development Gates

| Gate | Result | Detail |
|---|---:|---|
| Baseline policy request parity | pass | Exact timestamps/reasons and ordering passed |
| ACK-latency CDF | pass | 12/12 BUY/SELL threshold curves calibrated; no monotonicity violation |
| Probability identity | pass | Simplex valid; fill/cancel CIFs nondecreasing in time |
| Support | pass | 6/6 side-by-role curves passed |
| Joint Brier improvement | pass | Positive day-clustered lower bound on 6/6 curves |
| Fill Brier improvement | pass | Positive day-clustered lower bound on 6/6 curves |
| Absolute fill calibration | fail | 3/6 curves passed; BUY add, SELL add, and SELL reducing overpredicted |
| Cancel-ACK Brier improvement | fail | Lower bound was negative on 6/6 curves |
| Integrated cancel-ACK calibration | fail | Bias interval was below zero on 6/6 curves |
| Overall Development gate | **fail** | Validation remains closed |

The dynamic model's integrated fill bias ranged from about +0.11 to +0.36 percentage points. The integrated cancel-ACK bias ranged from about -1.37 to -0.96 percentage points. At the 5.010s cut cancel ACK was often slightly overpredicted, while at 5.801s and 7.801s it was underpredicted. The failure is therefore a curve-shape and conditional-race problem, not a single intercept.

## Interpretation

The new decomposition resolved the most important identity failure: cancel is no longer fitted as a stationary natural hazard. Marginal request-to-ACK CDF calibration is stable, and state-dependent fill features improve proper scores over a mechanism-matched exposure-only fill baseline.

That is not enough for an absolute action-value input. A side/role marginal ACK latency PMF does not fully transport through the varying request time and the selection induced by surviving without fill. Request reason, request-time system state, order age, and fill/ACK dependence can change the effective ACK CDF at each remaining horizon. The v1 race consequently assigns too much mass to no-event or fill and too little to later cancel ACK.

This result closes the v1 implementation, not the placement fill estimand and not the observed fill-ranking information. It also does not justify weakening the frozen gate after seeing Development.

## Next Research Boundary

A future version, if pre-frozen, should:

1. preserve deterministic baseline request replay and pending-cancel fills;
2. model request-to-ACK survival from causal request-time state and reason;
3. test dependence between ACK latency and fill survival rather than assuming a side/role marginal race is sufficient;
4. compare against the same mechanism-matched exposure-only fill baseline;
5. remain current-placement-only until prediction gates pass.

KEEP/REPLACE, queue reset, inventory lifecycle value, and action uplift remain separate experiments. No Validation access is recommended for this v1 family.
