This is a transitional replay/analysis package, not a directory containing only machine-learning models. The maintained tick executor, replay loaders, cache utilities and historical analysis entrypoints still live here. Do not add unrelated production contracts merely because this package already exists. See the [module ownership map](../docs/architecture.md) for actual owners and remaining migration work. Research-family implementations live in `research.families.*`; removed `research_*` roots are historical paths, not import aliases.

Generated model bundles are ignored by Git. A local research checkout should normally retain only:

- the bundle required to reproduce the current live process;
- the latest formally identified causal bundle;
- a scorer artifact that is still referenced by live/replay parity tests.

Do not promote a bundle merely because its files exist. Formal replay requires model metadata with bucket-end feature visibility, causal warmup and label semantics, plus independently identified P3, queue and latency artifacts. Superseded bundles must not enter the parameter-search candidate list. Record them as retention candidates first; remove them only after a reference audit and explicit approval preserve every required frozen identity.

## Current Runtime Boundary

Use `narrowgate replay --help` for maintained tick replay, `narrowgate tick-ab --help` for registered A/B execution, `narrowgate quote-diagnostics --help` for quote diagnostics and `narrowgate fill-depth-audit --help` for F10 fill/depth diagnostics. The independent bar, ML-bar, tick, A/B and quote-diagnostic module CLI commands are retired; `models.experiment_runner` no longer exists. Bar diagnostic functions remain library functions, not alternate economic replay commands. Quote configuration supplies `eta_inventory`, `a_spread`, `risk_per_order` and `inventory_reference_qty` explicitly; it does not inherit them from `gamma`.

Current Tardis model bundles require `narrowgate.semantic_model_bundle.v1` and semantic head names for touch-conditioned direction/price change, absolute-price variance rate and touch-side adverse probability. Old bundle schemas are rejected. Conversion preserves learned model values but produces a new artifact identity; frozen originals remain separate and are not changed by loading. Python and the native extension must have matching application-interface versions. This is a source migration, not a live deployment.

This document does not declare a currently deployed model or ML enablement. Resolve those from the authorized deployment configuration and verified runtime identity. Empirical P3 is a separate calibration component even when stored beside model files.

Shared live/replay epoch contracts now belong to `narrowgate/runtime/`; scalar quote-EV features belong to `features/quote_ev.py`. Production consumers do not import those features from F05. Family trainers and experimental orchestration remain with their registered family. Existing `models/audit/` code is analysis infrastructure, not the default home of new runtime contracts. `models/backtest_tick.py` remains the maintained tick executor; the historical one-second bar entrypoints cannot substitute for economic tick replay.

Before training, replay or tests, use the repository interpreter explicitly, for example `.venv/bin/python -m pytest`. A bundle may be removed only after a separate reference audit confirms that no live config, frozen manifest, parity test or reproducibility contract still names it.

## Canonical Predictive Ablations

`research.families.f03_causal_13_head.ml_model` is the only maintained training entrypoint for the causal 13-head family. Source-profile and taker-feature experiments use the same feature manifest, split, model metadata and training-summary contract as the base bundle. Print the frozen experiment definitions with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m research.families.f03_causal_13_head.ml_model --print-experiment-contract
```

A source-profile experiment is trained as a complete, independently named bundle:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m research.families.f03_causal_13_head.ml_model \
  --feature-dir /absolute/path/to/versioned_causal_features \
  --model-dir models/saved_btcusdc_source_local_only_v1 \
  --source-profile local_only \
  --feature-variant base \
  --experiment-id source_local_only_v1
```

Taker/depth feature variants use `--feature-variant`; source profile and feature variant may be combined in one predeclared experiment. Any non-base experiment requires an explicit model directory and experiment ID, trains all 13 heads, and records `promotion_authority=research_only`. Predictive metrics and replay results cannot independently grant live authority; live bundle validation rejects this marker unless a separate promotion process creates an authorized bundle identity.

## External Information Decay

`research/families/f04_external_market_alpha/external_venue_model.py` is retained as the research-only trainer for Bitget/Bybit/OKX spot/perpetual incremental information. It is separate from the causal 13-head bundle because historical external archives have a trade-time one-second ABI rather than the live receive-time ABI.

Current runs must declare a complete integer-second target grid with `--fast-horizons-s` or `--fast-horizon-max-s`. There is no default 1/3/5-second target set. The trainer derives labels from one causal cached close path, keeps early stopping inside Development, and writes a simultaneous day-cluster horizon-decay selection artifact. The former ten-second heads and explicit `--targets-fast` list are compatibility paths only. No external prediction artifact has live action authority. Test/late scoring requires the frozen Development selection artifact and is restricted to its single selected horizon.
